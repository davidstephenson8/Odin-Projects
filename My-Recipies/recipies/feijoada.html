    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>4 ounces diced bacon</li>
            <li>1 pound boneless pork shoulder, cut into 1 inch chunks</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>1 pound boneless beef short ribs, cut into 1 inch chunks (or carne seca - salted beef - if you can find it)</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>1 pound smoked sausage (linguica sausage if you can find it)</li>
            <li>1 large onion, diced</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon kosher salt or ¼ teaspoon table salt</li>
            <li>1 pound (2 ¼ cups) dried black beans, sorted and rinsed</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>5 cups water</li>
            <li>2 bay leaves</li>
            <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>Minced fresh parsley (optional)</li>
        </ul>
    <h4>Directions</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Brown the meats: Put the pressure cooker pot over medium heat (use sauté mode in an electric PC) and add the bacon to the pot. Cook until the bacon is browned and crispy, about 5 minutes. Remove the bacon from the pot to a large bowl with a slotted spoon, leaving as much bacon fat behind as possible. Add the pork to the pot in a single layer, sprinkle with ½ teaspoon of salt, and brown on one side, about 3 minutes. Move the pork to the bacon bowl with a slotted spoon. Add the beef to the pot in a single layer, sprinkle with ½ teaspoon of salt, and brown on one side, about 3 minutes. Move the beef to the bowl of meat with a slotted spoon. Add the smoked sausage to the pot in a single layer, and brown on one side, about 2 minutes. Move the sausage to the bowl of browned meat with a slotted spoon.</li>
            <li>Sauté the aromatics: Add the diced onion and smashed garlic to the pot, and sprinkle with ½ teaspoon of salt. Let the onion cook for a minute to start releasing liquid, then scrape the bottom of the pot with a flat-edged wooden spoon, loosening all the browned bits of meat into the onions. Keep sautéing the onions and garlic, occasionally scraping the bottom of the pot to loosen any browned bits, until the onions soften, about 5 more minutes.</li>
            <li>Pressure cook for 40 minutes with natural pressure release: Stir in the dried beans, then the bowl full of meat and any juices, Sprinkle with 1 teaspoon salt and the baking soda, then pour in the water and add the bay leaves. Lock the lid on the pressure cooker and cook at high pressure for 40 minutes in an electric PC, 35 minutes in a stovetop PC, and then let the pressure come down naturally, about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Taste, season and serve: Carefully remove the lid on the pressure cooker - the steam will be hot - and discard the bay leaves. Taste the stew for seasoning; it will need pepper, but probably not any more salt. Ladle into bowls, sprinkle with parsley, and serve.</li>
        </ol>
