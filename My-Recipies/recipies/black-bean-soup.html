    <img src="../images/Black-Bean-Soup.jpeg" alt="beany goodness">
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 green bell peppers, stems and seeds discarded, finely diced</li>
        <li>1 large onion, finely diced</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced on a microplane grater</li>
        <li>1 jalapeño or serrano pepper, stems and seeds discarded, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon dried chili flakes</li>
        <li>1 chipotle chili packed in adobo, finely chopped, plus 1 tablespoon adobo sauce from can (optional)</li>
        <li>1 quart homemade or low-sodium canned chicken broth</li>
        <li>2 (15-ounce) cans black beans, with liquid</li>
        <li>2 bay leaves</li>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Directions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat vegetable oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add peppers and onions and cook, stirring frequently, until softened but not browned, about 3 minutes. Add garlic, jalapeño, cumin, and dried chili flakes and cook, stirring constantly until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add chipotle and adobo sauce (if using) and stir to combine. Add chicken broth, beans and their liquid, and bay leaves. Increase heat to high, and bring to a boil. Reduce to a bare simmer, cover and cook for 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Discard the bay leaves. Use a hand blender to roughly puree part of the beans until desired consistency is reached. Alternatively, transfer 2 cups of soup to a blender or food processor and process until smooth (start on low speed and increase to high to prevent blender blow-out). Return to the soup and stir to combine. Season to taste with salt.</li>
        <li>Ladle soup into individual serving bowls and serve immediately with cilantro leaves, sour cream, diced avocado, and diced red onion (as desired).</li>
    </ol>
